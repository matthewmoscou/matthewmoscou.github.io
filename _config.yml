# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  The Moscou group focuses on understanding immunity in the grasses. Current
  themes in our research include dissecting the genetic architecture of nonhost
  resistance, tradeoffs between biotrophs and necrotrophs, seedling versus adult
  plant resistance, and suppression of resistance in polyploid genomes. The group
  uses genetics and bioinformatics to explore biology and solve long-standing puzzles.
