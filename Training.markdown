Seminal papers that have shaped my scientific experience.
Resources I have accessed over the years that have been extremely useful.


## Genetics
### Constructing genetic map

[JoinMap](https://www.kyazma.nl/)

Critical and example papers include:
>

### Quantitiative trait locus analysis


Critical papers include:
> Churchill and Doerge (1996) Permutations tests for multiple loci affecting a quantitative character. ***Genetics*** **142**:285-294.

### Transgressive segregation


Critical papers include:
> deVicente and Tanksley (1993) QTL analysis of transgressive segregation in an interspecific tomato cross. ***Genetics*** **134**:585-596.

## Genomics

### Toolsets for analyzing genomes
[EMBOSS](http://emboss.sourceforge.net/) provides a diverse set of programs to analyze genome, transcriptome, and proteome data
[GenomeQC](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12864-020-6568-2) sets out a framework for benchmarking different assembly strategies
[ORFcor](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0058387) for correcting gene models post-annotation

### Visualization of genes and genomes
[gggenes](https://github.com/wilkox/gggenes)  
[dgenies](https://github.com/genotoul-bioinfo/dgenies) provides dotplots for large genomes  
[smudgeplot](https://github.com/KamilSJaron/smudgeplot) provides visualization of ploidy and heterozygosity structure  

### Assembling complex regions of the genome
[HiCanu](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.14.992248v1)

## Molecular Evolution
[PAML](http://evomics.org/learning/phylogenetics/paml/)  
[MrBayes](http://nbisweden.github.io/MrBayes/) uses Bayesian inference and model choice over several phylogenetic and evolutionary models.  

## Plant-Microbe Interaction

### *R* genes versus QTLs
There has been a long-standing debate about the potential relationship between *R* gene-mediated resistance and minor effect QTLs identified based on field-based phenotyping.

Critical papers include:
> Li *et al.* (1999) A "defeated" rice resistance gene acts as a QTL against a virulent strain of *Xanthomonas oryzae* pv. *oryzae*. ***Molecular Genomics and Genetics*** **261**:58-63.
