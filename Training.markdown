Seminal papers that have shaped my scientific experience.
Resources I have accessed over the years that have been extremely useful.


## Genetics
### Constructing genetic map

[JoinMap](https://www.kyazma.nl/)

Critical and example papers include:
>

### Quantitiative trait locus analysis


Critical papers include:
> Churchill and Doerge (1996) Permutations tests for multiple loci affecting a quantitative character. ***Genetics*** **142**:285-294.

### Transgressive segregation


Critical papers include:
> deVicente and Tanksley (1993) QTL analysis of transgressive segregation in an interspecific tomato cross. ***Genetics*** **134**:585-596.

## Genomics

### Visualization of genes and genomes
[gggenes](https://github.com/wilkox/gggenes)  
[dgenies](https://github.com/genotoul-bioinfo/dgenies) provides dotplots for large genomes  
[smudgeplot](https://github.com/KamilSJaron/smudgeplot) provides visualization of ploidy and heterozygosity structure  

## Molecular Evolution
[PAML](http://evomics.org/learning/phylogenetics/paml/)  
[MrBayes](http://nbisweden.github.io/MrBayes/) uses Bayesian inference and model choice over several phylogenetic and evolutionary models.  

## Plant-Microbe Interaction

### *R* genes versus QTLs
There has been a long-standing debate about the potential relationship between *R* gene-mediated resistance and minor effect QTLs identified based on field-based phenotyping.

Critical papers include:
> Li *et al.* (1999) A "defeated" rice resistance gene acts as a QTL against a virulent strain of *Xanthomonas oryzae* pv. *oryzae*. ***Molecular Genomics and Genetics*** **261**:58-63.
