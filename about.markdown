The Moscou laboratory is located at [The Sainsbury Laboratory](www.tsl.ac.uk) in Norwich, United Kingdom. The group was initially a part of the [2Blades Group](http://www.tsl.ac.uk/groups/twoblades/) in 2010 and later became an independent group in 2014. Our research was initially focused on identifying novel sources of durable disease resistance to wheat stripe rust (<i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i>), but how now expanded to several themes including:
* Genetic architecture of nonhost resistance in grasses to fungal pathogens
* Multiple pathogen recognition of <i>R</i> genes
* Molecular tradeoffs in immunity to biotrophs and necrotrophs
* Suppression of resistance in polyploid genomes
* Genomics of immunity in cereals
* Pre-zygotic and post-zygotic hybridization barriers and their relationship to plant immunity
