## Outreach
Our group actively engages with the scientific and wider community through personal and electronic communication. We adhere to goals of open access and ensure the availability of raw data, analysis pipelines, manuscript, and reviews. In parallel, we are currently developing tutorials in several common challenges in studying genetics and bioinformatics.
